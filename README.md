Technologies: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, HTML, CSS

Developed a sentiment analysis web application to classify feedback as positive or negative.



Implemented end-to-end pipeline including text preprocessing, vocabulary building, and vectorization.



Built and trained a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) for sentiment prediction using Scikit-learn.



Integrated the machine learning model into a Flask-based web application for real-time feedback analysis.



Added logging functionality to monitor application performance and track user interactions, demonstrating full-stack integration and machine learning deployment expertise.
